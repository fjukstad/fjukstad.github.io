I'm also doing my best to teach others! I've been teaching at university and
organizing the local [Code Club in Troms√∏](http://kodeklubben-tromso.github.io)
for the last couple of years. On this page I've tried to list all of it below
with some links to source code or other materials. Although I believe that
everything I do at the University should be open, I was unfortunately not
allowed to open-source everything I built for the uni courses! 

### Teaching and Projects at UiT

- [air:bit](http://airbit.uit.no) Project Leader. More
  than 10 schools in Northern Norway build and code air quality sensor kits
  (air:bits) designed at the School Laboratory. Using their air:bits they
  collect air pollution data from Norway. School Laboratory @ UiT.
- [Introduction to coding with the BBC Micro:bit](), School Laboratory @ UiT. 
- [Creating web sites from scratch using HTML and
  CSS.](https://github.com/skolelab/nettsider), School Laboratory @ UiT. 
- [Introduction to Arduinos and electronics.

### Code Club

  program by modding Minecraft. This was really fun!

  and advanced courses in Unity.
