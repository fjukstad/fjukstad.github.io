I'm also doing my best to teach others! I've been TA'ing at uni and organizing
the local [Code Club in Troms√∏](http://kodeklubben-tromso.github.io) for the last couple
of years. On this page I've tried to list all of it below with some links to 
source code or other materials. Although I believe that everything I do at the 
University should be open, I was unfortunately not allowed to open-source 
everything I built for the uni courses! 

### Uni

  from scratch using HTML and CSS.
