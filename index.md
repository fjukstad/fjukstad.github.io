I'm a Ph. D. student in computer science at UiT - The Arctic University of
Norway. I'm working on interactive systems for explorative analyses of data from
the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study. I'm a member of the [Biological
Data Processing Lab (BDPS)](http://bdps.cs.uit.no/) in the
[HPDS](http://hpds.cs.uit.no/) research group, and a student in the
[EPINOR](http://site.uit.no/epinor/) research school. I also organize the 
local [code club in Troms√∏](http://kodeklubben-tromso.github.io)!
