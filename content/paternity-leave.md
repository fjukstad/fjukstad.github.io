10 months ago I became a father for the first time! To keep track of how far I
pushed my baby boy around in a stroller/jogger during my paternal leave, I
created a small web app with tech that was unfamiliar to me. 65 days into my
paternity leave I've covered 503 kilometers, and I've been out more than 100
hours.

I usually track my runs/hikes/skiing with my Garmin Fenix 3 watch, which syncs
to [Strava](https://strava.com). Since I usually don't record any regular walks
with my GPS watch, the app fetches all walks from Strava during my paternity
leave and plots them on a map including some summary statistics.

The app is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and deployed to
[pappaperm.vercel.app](https://pappaperm.vercel.app) with
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) where you can check it out yourself. If you'd like
to checkout the code, I've open-sourced it on
[github.com/fjukstad/pappaperm](https://github.com/fjukstad/pappaperm).
I had a great time deploying the app with Vercel, and tweeted about it which
generated a bit of traffic on my, not so busy, Twitter account.

I think I'll make it to 700 kilometers before I return to work, but we'll see!
