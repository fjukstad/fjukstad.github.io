This spring I have adviced a group of four bachelor students in computer science
from [UiT campus Bodø](https://uit.no/sted/bodo?sted=190772). The team has
worked on machine learning on openEHR data, and as a result have produced a lot
of great software.

Two of the packages the team has developed on are
[openehR](https://github.com/dipsas/openehR) and
[openehpy](https://github.com/dipsas/openehpy).
These are packages for retrieving data from an openEHR server through its
openEHR REST API. Both packages get data from an openEHR REST API, and you can
use the pacakges to get data from any system that implements the API. At DIPS,
we have used them in a research project to get EHR data to train machine
learning models. Today we have open-sourced the packages, and you can find them
at [github.com/dipsas/openehR](https://github.com/dipsas/openehR) and
[github.com/dipsas/openehpy](https://github.com/dipsas/openehpy).

Please reach out to me at [bfj@dips.no](mailto:bfj@dips.no) if you have any
questions!
