A couple of weeks ago I published a post on [how we enable data science at
DIPS](/blog/enabling-data-science-in-dips), which told the story on how we can
get data from our openEHR server in the R programming language. To make things
even more interesting, this post will show how we can get screening symptoms
from COVID-19 patients registered in our openEHR Server in DIPS Arena. With this
data we can create reports with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com),
beautiful [Shiny dashboards](https://shiny.rstudio.com), and open up for
researchers to explore and analyze the data in their own environment.

This spring at [DIPS](https://dips.com/uk) we have developed systems to register
a patient's COVID-19-specific symptoms, if contact tracing has been started, and
the results from the diagnostic tests.
(News story in Norwegian
[here](https://www.nrk.no/nordland/dips-med-app-som-skal-hjelpe-med-kartlegging-og-sporing-av-koronavirus-1.14982075))
These systems all built on [openEHR](https://openehr.org) which makes it easy
for us to perform downstream analysis of the data in R, or any other programming
language. Below is a screenshot from the application. The data in the screenshot
is of course synthetic.

Lets see how simple it is for us to get all symptoms registered  on patients in
our systems. We start with loading the `openehR` and other necessary packages.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(openehR)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)


```

Then we specify the
[AQL](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/QUERY/latest/AQL.html) query
to get the symptoms: 

```{r}
query = 
"SELECT
c/context/start_time/value as DateTime,
o/data[at0001]/events[at0002]/data[at0003]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.symptom_sign-cvid.v0 and name/value='Hoste']/items[at0.1]/value/value as Cough,
o/data[at0001]/events[at0002]/data[at0003]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.symptom_sign-cvid.v0 and name/value='Kortpustet']/items[at0.1]/value/value as ShortnessOfBreath,
o/data[at0001]/events[at0002]/data[at0003]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.symptom_sign-cvid.v0 and name/value='Feber']/items[at0.1]/value/value as Fever,
FROM
    COMPOSITION c
       CONTAINS observation o[openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.story.v1]
       CONTAINS cluster cl[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.symptom_sign-cvid.v0]
ORDER BY
    c/context/start_time/value DESC
"
```

In short, we are interested in if the patient is coughing, has shortness of
breath, or has a fever. In this blog post, the data is completely synthetic.
We can use the `openehR` package to execute the query. The `url` is just the
HTTP REST API endpoint of an openEHR server, e.g.
`http://openehr-server/openehr`.

```{r, include=F}
url = "https://vt-demo2-app02.demo.dips.no:4443/openehr"
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
data =  openehR::query(url, query)

kable(head(data), format="markdown")

```

Since the data is in Norwegian, I'll translate the recorded values: 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
data = data %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(str_replace(., "Tilstede", "Present"))) %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(str_replace(., "Ukjent", "Unknown"))) %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(str_replace(., "FravÃ¦rende", "Not present"))) %>% 
  mutate_at("DateTime", ymd_hms) %>%
  arrange(DateTime)

kable(head(data), format="markdown")
```

We can then plot the number of patients screened every week, grouping them on coughing status.

```{r}
data %>%
  mutate(week = isoweek(DateTime)) %>% 
  group_by(week, Cough) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=week, y=count, fill=Cough)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity', position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single"))   + 
  xlab("Week") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  labs(title="Patients screened per week", fill="Coughing Status") + 
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=unique(isoweek(data$DateTime))) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#dd4b39","#00a65a","#0074B7"))

```

Further we could look at the COVID-19 diagnostic statuses, maybe even drill down
to what other types of diseases are registered on these patients. By using openEHR
to record the symptoms and other clinical data, it becomes a simple task for 
data analysts to get hold of tidy analysis-ready structured datasets. 

# Bonus: Shiny Apps 

With the above code we can easily develop [Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) 
that bring together the plots and tables in a web app. Below is a screenshot
of a prototype I developed over the course of a week. While the text labels are
all in Norwegian (because our customers are Norwegian), the screenshot shows an
example of how we can use R together with openEHR to develop specialized
applications in almost little time. This is because the data registered by 
clinicians are structured, and we can access them through a standardized API.

What is extremely powerful here, is that we get data from the patient journal 
system through the [openEHR REST API](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest/index.html). 
With the openEHR REST API specification, any vendor to implement the REST API
and share apps built on top of this API. While some patient journal systems lock
away the data in proprietary formats and applications, the openEHR REST API
makes the data easily accessible to the actual owners of the data.
