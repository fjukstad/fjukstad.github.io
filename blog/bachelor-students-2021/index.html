		<h1 class="post-title">Bachelor Students 2021</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>This spring I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to advise two student groups in computer science
at UiT The Arctic University of Norway in Bodø.  There&rsquo;s already a news post in
Norwegian about this year&rsquo;s students <a href="https://www.dips.com/no/skrev-bachelor-dips">on the DIPS
website</a> (in Norwegian), but I
wanted to go into a bit more detail on what they worked on.</p>
<p>Last year I had a group of four students, who worked on machine learning with
electronic health record data at DIPS. Unfortunately I did not take my time to
summarize their work, and that&rsquo;s something I want to fix this year.  If you
want to read a short summary of what the students did last year, <a href="https://www.dips.com/no/fra-kode-bacheloroppgave-til-fast-jobb">you can read
the news post on the DIPS
website</a> (in
Norwegian as well).</p>
<p>The students worked on pretty different problems. The first team was
given the challenge to develop a system that allows
<a href="https://www.withings.com">Withings</a> users to share their electrocardiograms
(ECGs) with our patient journal system. The second team was given the challenge
to extract relevant clinical information from unstructured clinical texts.</p>
<p>The two groups started their work this January, and delivered their bachelor
theses a couple of weeks ago. I met with them every week to catch up on the
development, give some advise, and help them solve their tasks. I&rsquo;m really
impressed by the work that the students put in, and the results that I present
in this short blog post are their work. Here are the two teams that I was
fortunate to advise:</p>
<p><strong>Team ECG</strong>: Johanne Holst Klæboe, Sander Holdal, Ole Jørgen Hongset,
Kristoffer Jakobsen</p>
<p><strong>Team NLP</strong>: Christopher Hansen Gabrielsen, Kristoffer S. Dahl, Ådne Wolden
Ovesen, William Harald Elvis Aamodt</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/students.png" alt="The two student teams"></p>
<h1 id="structured-ecgs">Structured ECGs</h1>
<p>The goal of this project was to store ECGs from Withings smart watches into our
openEHR server at DIPS. Traditionally ECGs have been stored as static PDFs in
the electronic health record systems, but in this project we wanted to explore
the possibility of storing ECGs as structured data. Storing the raw ECGs makes
it possible to re-use the data later, and significantly reduces the storage
requirements needed to store an ECG.</p>
<p>In DIPS we store structured clinical data as openEHR archetypes, so a part of
the student&rsquo;s work is to transform the ECGs from Withings' API into openEHR
archetypes.  If you want an intro to
what openEHR is, <a href="https://digitalhealth.wales/news/what-openehr-and-why-it-important">I recommend that you read John Meredith&rsquo;s post on the
topic</a>. In
short, it&rsquo;s how we model clinical concepts, and describes how we can e.g. store
the results from an ECG.</p>
<p>The project consisted of five main parts;</p>
<ol>
<li>authorize an app to get a person&rsquo;s ECGs,</li>
<li>fetch ECGs from the Withings API,</li>
<li>convert them to openEHR archetype data,</li>
<li>store them in the openEHR server</li>
<li>develop a simple visualization dashboard that fetches the stored ECGs from
the openEHR server, and visualizes the ECGs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Withings provide raw ECG measurements from their
<a href="https://developer.withings.com">API</a>. The students set up an application to
fetch data, and the necessary OAuth flow to let user&rsquo;s authorize the app to get
their ECGs. Once retrieved, the students had to convert the raw measurements into
a data format based on openEHR archetypes. With help from <a href="https://twitter.com/bjornna">Bjørn
Næss</a> we landed on an initial approach to represent
the ECGs. In short the data we&rsquo;re storing in our openEHR server is a <a href="https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.1324">Result
report</a> with the <a href="https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.276">ECG
result</a>, along with
information about the <a href="https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.17">device</a>
that was used to collect the ECG. Data data is serialized as JSON
and posted to our openEHR server via the <a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest/ehr.html#composition-composition-post">openEHR REST
API</a></p>
<p>When the data is stored in our openEHR backend, the students used the <a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/QUERY/latest/AQL.html">Archetype
query language
(AQL)</a> to
retrieve all ECGs to visualize them in the web user interface. Below is an
example from the web application that was developed by the students. It shows an
interactive ECG visualization, with the possibility of navigating between
different ECGs recorded by this patient.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/ecg-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the final web application. The screenshot shows theinteractive ECG visualization, along with all the available ECGs for thispatient on the right hand side. "></p>
<h1 id="unstructured-clinical-text">Unstructured clinical text</h1>
<p>In electronic health record systems, a lot of the information is stored as
unstructured free text documents and notes. While this is great for using a
clinician&rsquo;s natural language, it becomes difficult to find and extract specific
parts of the document that may be of interest. E.g. finding blood pressures,
symptoms or medications in the free text.</p>
<p>In this project the students were given the challenge to discover and extract
important bits of information from unstructured clinical text. While real
clinical texts may be difficult to get access to, my colleague <a href="https://www.ous-research.no/home/edvardsen/group%20members/18806">Pål
Brekke</a> got
access to ~30 000 articles from <a href="https://tidsskriftet.no">The Journal of the Norwegian Medical
Association</a>. These articles contain case studies with
descriptions of patient&rsquo;s disease, and we hypothesized that these are similar to
text found in the journal.</p>
<p>The students were given the <a href="https://github.com/ltgoslo/NorMedTerm">NorMedTerm</a>
lexical resource resource of medical entities mapped to semantic categories. Based on these terms, they set out to develop a system that automatically extracted these terms from the text, and presented them to the user.</p>
<p>In short, the project consisted of four main parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>fetch the NorMedTerm lexical resource for later lookup,</li>
<li>parse the ~30 000 articles stored as XML files,</li>
<li>discover the relevant entities in the articles based on NorMedTerm</li>
<li>present the articles and discovered entities to the user in a user interface</li>
</ol>
<p>NorMedTerm is available as a <code>.csv</code> on their Github page, and is distributed
under a CC BY 4.0 license. Based on NorMedTerm, the students developed an API
that takes a clinical note, finds all medical terms, and returns a description
of the entities and their positions in the text. Based on this API, they
developed an interactive web application that allows users to browse the ~30 000
articles, and the discovered entities on the same page.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot from the web application. The user is browsing an article
on Covid-19, and relevant substances, conditions and other entities are
highlighted in the text. Based on these findings, the website could also hint to
other similar articles.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/nlp-1.png" alt="A screenshot of the finished web application. The user is browsing an articleon Covid-19, and relevant substances, conditions and other entities arehighlighted in the text. Based on these findings, the website could also hint toother similar articles."></p>
<p>Since the students developed an API for discovering entities, my colleague <a href="https://no.linkedin.com/in/thor-stenb%C3%A6k-737837bb">Thor
Stenbæk</a> used their API
in his new <em>smart</em> text editor in DIPS. Below you&rsquo;ll see a screenshot of how
that looks like. Pretty cool!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/nlp-2.png" alt="A screenshot of a smart text editor in DIPS that automatically discoversrelevant entities, based on the work the students did"></p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>In summary, the two groups have worked on different topics and built some
pretty cool stuff. I believe that the structured ECGs are just the beginning of
how we can start integrating personal data into the electronic health record system.
Using natural language processing techniques on clinical notes is definitely
something we&rsquo;re going to see more in the future.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get my hands on more students to do cool stuff next year as well!</p>
